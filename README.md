# Chat-App
# Description
This is an react native app for messaging. In this project, React Native, Expo and Google Firestore Database are used to build this chat app.

# Key Features
1. A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat.
2. A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
3. The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.
4. Data gets stored online and offline.

# User Stories

friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.

reader so that I can engage with a chat interface
